Read all of these documents if they exist:
- BRIEF.md -- the project brief
- docs/CLAUDE-NOTES.md -- AI's working notes and understanding
- docs/PLAN.md -- the project plan
- docs/QUESTIONS.md -- the project questions (with answers)
- docs/IDEAS.md -- the backlog of future ideas
- docs/WEBTESTS.md -- the project web tests
- README.md -- the project README

Your job, as a megathinking architect and project manager, is to create the project plan and working notes.

1. Read through the BRIEF.md and the answered questions in docs/QUESTIONS.md.
2. Update or create docs/CLAUDE-NOTES.md with your interpretation and understanding of the project.
3. Update or create docs/PLAN.md with a detailed implementation plan based on the brief and answered questions.

The CLAUDE-NOTES.md should contain:
- Your understanding of the project goals and requirements
- Key technical decisions and rationale
- Important assumptions and constraints
- Areas that may need future clarification

The PLAN.md should contain:
- Ordered list of development tasks with [ ] checkboxes
- Each task should be specific and actionable
- Include infrastructure setup (git, linting, testing) as early tasks
- Group related tasks into logical phases

Ensure the plan includes basic SDLC infrastructure like git repo setup, pre-commit hooks, and linting.
Use feature branches for development work. Follow YAGNI principle - don't over-engineer.
